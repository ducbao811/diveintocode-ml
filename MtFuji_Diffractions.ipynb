    "Outside of our Sun, our system's nearest neighbor is Alpha Centauri. This isn't a single star, it's actually a triple-star system â€” three stars bound together by gravity. The two main stars are Alpha Centauri A and Alpha Centauri B, which form a binary pair. They are an average of 4.3 light-years from Earth. The third star is Proxima Centauri. It is about 4.22 light-years from Earth and is the closest star other than the sun. The calculation of the distance from our planet to Proxima Centauri is performed using the function below"
